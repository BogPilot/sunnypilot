"""AP1 stalk distance scroll to FrogPilot follow profiles.

Pure mapping. No CAN, no params, no controlsd, no actuation.

DTR_Dist_Rq on STW_ACTN_RQ (opendbc tesla_can.dbc and tesla_powertrain.dbc,
and Tinkla carstate): 0, 33, 66, 100, 133, 166, 200 are ACC_DIST_1..7.
255 is SNA. Those two sources agree, so this module does not invent a third scale.

Follow seconds are the stock FrogPilot defaults, not live params:
  traffic cruising gap is TRAFFIC_FOLLOW at v_ego >= CRUISING_SPEED (5 m/s): 1.00s
    (the same curve is 0.50s at 0 m/s; this module has no v_ego and does not apply it)
  aggressive / standard / relaxed are get_T_FOLLOW with custom_personalities false:
    1.25 / 1.45 / 1.75
  which match AggressiveFollow, StandardFollow, and RelaxedFollow defaults.
Intermediate detents use the midpoint of the neighboring named times. Each midpoint
is equidistant from those neighbors, so collapsing onto a cereal personality would
be arbitrary. get_T_FOLLOW is not imported: that module pulls car interfaces and
setproctitle. Do not edit get_T_FOLLOW or long_mpc to add a profile.

Car state calls parse_stalk_raw and keeps the decision on the CarState
instance (stalk_follow). Cereal is not extended. AP1 publishes follow_s on
the existing cruiseState.speedOffset (0 when not ready). FrogPilotFollowing
copies that into tFollow. Detent 1 sets trafficModeEnabled. Detents 3, 5,
and 7 write the existing LongitudinalPersonality param (aggressive, standard,
relaxed) so the on-screen personality icon changes. Detents 2, 4, and 6 are
follow times only. 255 holds the last detent inside map_stalk_follow.
No new persisted param.
